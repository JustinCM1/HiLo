This project is a hilo game where the user guesses if the random card, will be higher or lower than the previous card. 

It uses two classes, deck and dealer. The deck class makes a random card that spans from 1 to 13. And the dealer class keeps tracks of the points, showing the last card, 
and asking the user if they still wanna play. 

And the main program just pulls everything together for the game to work.
